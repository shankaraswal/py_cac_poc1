# py_cac_poc1

A Python codebase showcasing core programming concepts with practical modules and code samples.  
This repository is designed for learning and reference, especially useful for those interested in exploring Python fundamentals in a hands-on manner.

## Functionality and Features

- **Closure Functions** (`py_closure`):
  Learn about Python closures, how to create them, and practical use cases.
- **Decorators** (`py_decorators`):
  Explore Python decorators, including custom examples and how they modify or enhance function behaviors.
- **Functions** (`py_funcitons`):
  Examples of recursive functions (e.g., calculating factorials) and best practices.
- **Iterations** (`py_iterations`):
  Demonstrations of Python's iteration patterns, such as file iteration.
- **Loops** (`py_loops`):
  Implementations of unique algorithms using Python loops, like extracting unique items from an array.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shankaraswal/py_cac_poc1.git
   cd py_cac_poc1
   ```
2. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   *(No external dependencies specified; pure Python code. If needed, add your requirements to `requirements.txt` and run:)*
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run
